# TODO list

An unsorted list of wishes for Feditext.

- Some sort of C2S protocol
  - FBI2 anon asks for something standardized that works across instances.
- Sage
- Post partial
  - Requires some data that gets passed to the page (privs, private mode?)
- Postgres backend
  - SQLite3 is great but has its own problems. It shouldn't be too hard to port.
- Update database tests
