<h1>Frequently Asked Questions <a href="/">[back]</a></h1>

<p>None of these were asked but it's here for the sake of completeness.</p>

<h2>What is Feditext, anyway?</h2>

<p>
Feditext is a federated textboard, similar in idea to
<a href="https://fchan.xyz">FChannel</a>.
</p>

<p>
Users can create <b>text-only</b> posts which will be propagated to other
instances that follow a board on this instances.
Users on other boards that we follow will be propagated to us.
This allows a model where no one entity owns 100% of the network; anyone is
free to spin up an instance of their own and join the network or to create
their own network.
</p>

<p>
The source code is available on
<a href="https://github.com/KushBlazingJudah/feditext">GitHub</a>.
Contributions, complaints, and bug reports are welcome.

<h2>What can I do while posting?</h2>

<p>
Post contents are limited to {{.postmax}} characters, however in that you can
quote and cite other people and instances.
</p>

<p>
You can quote with a single "&gt;"; the rest of the line will be marked as a post.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> <code>abc &gt;hello world</code> -&gt;
abc <span class="quote">&gt;hello world</span>
</p>

<p>
You can cite with "&gt;&gt;" and a post number, or like on FChannel, if you
have an ActivityPub link you can cite with that too.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> <code>&gt;&gt;22</code>,
<code>&gt;&gt;https://fchan.xyz/prog/AF085BFA</code>
</p>

<p>
The name field accepts any name {{.namelen}} long; this includes a marker that
can be used as a unique identifier called a "tripcode".
While entering your name, enter a single "#" for an <b>insecure</b> tripcode,
enter "##" for a <b>secure</b> tripcode.
Data after the hashes is called a "password"; do not use your actual password
here.
Your tripcode is generated from this password, and as such changes every time
you change it.
<p>

<p>
The differences between an insecure tripcode and a secure tripcode is slim; one
is much easier to predict and is commonly used for vanity, the other is much
harder to predict as it uses secret data on this server.
</p>

<p>
The options field allows you to "noko", or return to a thread when you post,
and "sage" doesn't bump the thread you post to.
You can use "nokosage" to do both at once.
</p>

<h2>How do I view an entire thread?</h2>

<p>Click the "#" on any post; it will bring you to the thread.</p>

<h2>I keep seeing things like [5:2] on the top of threads. What do the numbers mean?</h2>

<p>The first number is the amount of posts, the second number is the amount of unique posters or instances.</p>

{{if gt (len .donate) 0}}
<h2>I want to donate to this instance. How?</h2>

<p>The instance admin has {{len .donate}} way{{if gt (len .donate) 1}}s{{end}} for you to donate:</p>

<ul>
	{{range $k, $v := .donate}}
	<li>{{$k}}: {{$v}}</li>
	{{end}}
</ul>
{{end}}

<h2>Why do the posts have sequential ID numbers?</h2>

<p>
Sequential ID numbers have not run their course, random base36 is not better.
</p>

<p>
<i>On the ActivityPub side we actually use random hex IDs; this exists solely
as a nod to FChannel's FAQ which has served as inspiration for most of
this.</i>
These hex IDs are currently hidden behind the sequential ID system; they may be
made accessible from your side eventually.
